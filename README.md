# DelphiGrammar
Grammer for Embarcadero Delphi in BNF form

This is a collaborative project to create a complete grammar of the Delphi programming language in BNF (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form). This grammar should be helpful for creating tools for this language which work on or with Delphi source code. If you like to get commit rights to this project create an issue stating so.
